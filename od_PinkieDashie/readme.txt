--PPRD Readme--

My first ever ghost! Welcome to the Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash ghost! Pinkie and Dashie chat on your screen and you can pet them on their head and face (by moving the mouse over those areas, not clicking, although you can use the mouse wheel also), or even kiss (double click) them on those two places :P If you double click anywhere else on Pinkie, a menu appears which you can use to hear what's on the duo's mind currently, hear the last thing they said, play a game, have them ask you a question, or ask about their lives. If you double click on Rainbow, you'll get some cool stuff ;) but other than that, you can report a bug or update 'em.

Hotkeys:
t - talk
r - repeat what they said last
f1 - open readme (this file!)

This ghost is redistributable, but don't delete anything! You can fix minor errors (typos, etc.), but be sure to add a notice that you did so in this Readme. You don't have to give me credit, but if you want to, just put this somewhere in the readme, or on the page where you have it for download: Created by Odie Dog. You can copy this as a template to make your own ghost for some reason, though, instead of the amazing one at: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html, by Zarla, or one of the templates by Zichqec, which I recommend you use instead. :P
