--MLPB Readme--
Created by Odie at appledog77.github.io
My first ever balloon! Welcome to the MLP balloon! Meant to be used with my ghost Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash, but you can use it for anything else! In fact, it's public domain :D

This balloon's .zip file is redistributable, but don't delete anything! You don't have to give me credit, but if you want to, just put this somewhere on the page where you have it for download: Created by Odie Dog. You can copy this to make your own balloon for some reason, though, instead of the amazing one at: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html, by Zarla, or the awesome one at https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/template/index#simplicity_balloon by Zichqec, which I recommend you use instead. :P
